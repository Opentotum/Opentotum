Getting 3D prints to Stick to the build platform



 There is a problem that everyone who is using 3D printers will have: sticking the printed parts to the build platform.
 It depends on the material used and other factors. There are different ways to prevent this problem: 

Calibrating the bed


Description:  A well calibration will create a constant thickness first layer, the material cools homogeneusly and the printing nozzle will not hit the printed part. With the FABtotum is very easy to calibrate the bed, using the guided procedure. 

Cleaned heated glass


Description:  The simpliest way: if you clean very well the glass of the printing plate using glass cleaner removing every part of dust, glues and fingerprints and heat the bed (at 60-70°C) the printer will work perfectly. 


 Advantages: Cheap, easy 

Disvantages: Couldn’t work perfectly 

Hair spray


Description: It’s one of the easiest and the cheapest solution for stick the 3d printed parts to the bed. It’s better to remove the bed from the printer, by removing the bed to his housing, for not damage smooth rods and other precision parts. Cor remove the spray, rub the surface with a paper napkin with a bit of water. 

We tried different brands and they work all good. 


 Advantages: Cheap, easy 

Disvantages: 

Paper tape


Descripion: This is another common method, there are severals types of paper tape, the most used is the 3M blue tape, but we tested also the common yellow tape, and it worked 

Advantages: It sticks very good. 

Disvantages: The blue tape could be difficult to find. Not so cheap. After the print could be difficult to remove the printed parts to the bed and could be possible to damage the tape necessitating another tape application. 

ABS slurry


Description: It is a slurry made with ABS molten in acetone. It’s made using ABS scraps and old wrong prints left in a acetone jar for few minutes, until the ABS is completely dissolved. It can be applied using cotton discs or a brush. Don’t smell the vapours after the application. 

Advantages: 

Disvantages: Toxic vapours 

Vinyl glue


Advantages 

Disvantages 

Stick glue


Easy to find and to apply (is made for an easy application).  

Advantages: Easy application 

Disvantages 

Kapton tape


Description: Polyimide tape commonly used in 3D printing. It’s quite expensive and it should be very clean for work better. Could be difficult to find it in local stores and to apply to the printing glass. 

Advantages: Heat resistant 

Disvantages: Expensive
